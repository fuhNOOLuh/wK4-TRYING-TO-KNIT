## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Here is where my text starts
## Problems I had getting to this point
The original rmd from MyAberdeen knitted to PDF fine but when I tried to repeat it I got an error. I didn't understand the error message. Is it that it can't overwrite an existed knitted PDF? It seems that way because it works if I go and delete the previously knitted PDF.
\
Then, I couldn't remember how to create a new markdown file and there was no Source window. I googled it and started adding this text. So far I have two levels of heading and a blank line, as well as prose. 
  
>This is a quote. At first it would not render properly and I couldn't find why. So, I pasted my markdown into chatgpt and asked it. It said that the backslash I had preceding the quote to make a line break might be combining with the chevron to mean something else. So, I replaced the backslashes with double spaces and now it works. 
  
Now I have a code chunk where I assign the words of the nato alphabet to the letters of my name. This is assigning *'values*'to *'objects'*.
```{r}
a <- "alpha"
f <- "foxtrot"
i <- "india"
l <- "lima"
n <- "november"
o <- "oscar"
u <- "uniform"
```

**This is prose between chunks. It is bold.**
\
Next I have a chunk to call on the objects I previously assigned values to but I don't know how to do that so they'll return all in a line yet, so it's just the f.
```{r}
f
```
